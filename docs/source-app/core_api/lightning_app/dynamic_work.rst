Dynamic Work

**Audience:** Users who want to learn how to create application which adapts to user demands.

**Level:** Intermediate

***************************************************
Why should I care about creating work dynamically ?
***************************************************

Imagine you want to create a research notebook app for your team, where every member can create multiple `JupyterLab <https://jupyter.org/>`_ session on their hardware of choice.

To allow every notebook to choose hardware, it needs to be set up in it's own :class:`~lightning_app.core.work.LightningWork`, but you can't know the number of notebooks user will need in advance. In this case you'll need to add ``LightningWorks`` dynamically at run time.

This is what **dynamic works** enables.

***************************
When to use dynamic works ?
***************************

Dynamic works should be used anytime you want change the resources your application is using at runtime.

*******************
How to add a work ?
*******************

You can simply attach your components in the **run** method of a flow using python **hasattr**, **setattr** and **getattr** functions.

.. code-block:: python

    class RootFlow(lapp.LightningFlow):

        def run(self):

            if not hasattr(self, "work"):
                setattr(self, "work", Work()) # The `Work` component is created and attached here.
            getattr(self,  "work").run() # Run the `Work` component.

But it is usually more readable to use Lightning built-in :class:`~lightning_app.structures.Dict` or :class:`~lightning_app.structures.List` as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from lightning_app.structures import Dict

    class RootFlow(lapp.LightningFlow):

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.dict = Dict()

        def run(self):
            if "work" not in self.dict:
                self.dict["work"] = Work()  # The `Work` component is attached here.
            self.dict["work"].run()


********************
How to stop a work ?
********************

In order to stop a work, simply use the work ``stop`` method as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    class RootFlow(lapp.LightningFlow):

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.work = Work()

        def run(self):
            self.work.stop()


**********************************
Application Example with StreamLit
**********************************

..
    The entire application can be found `here <https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning-template-jupyterlab>`_.

The Notebook Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the component below, we are dynamically creating ``JupyterLabWork`` every time as user clicks the ``Create Jupyter Notebook`` button.

To do so, we are iterating over the list of ``jupyter_config_requests`` infinitely.

.. code-block:: python

    import lightning_app as la

    class JupyterLabManager(lapp.LightningFlow):

        """This flow manages the users notebooks running within works.""""

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.jupyter_works = lapp.structures.Dict()
            self.jupyter_config_requests = []

        def run(self):
            for idx, jupyter_config in enumerate(self.jupyter_config_requests):

                # The Jupyter Config has this form is:
                # {"use_gpu": False/True, "token": None, "username": ..., "stop": False}

                # Step 1: Check if JupyterWork already exists for this username
                username = jupyter_config["username"]
                if username not in self.jupyter_works:
                    jupyter_config["ready"] = False

                    # Set the hardware selected by the user: GPU or CPU.
                    cloud_compute = lapp.CloudCompute("gpu" if jupyter_config["use_gpu"] else "cpu-small")

                    # Step 2: Create new JupyterWork dynamically !
                    self.jupyter_works[username] = JupyterLabWork(cloud_compute=cloud_compute)

                # Step 3: Run the JupyterWork
                self.jupyter_works[username].run()

                # Step 4: Store the notebook token in the associated config.
                # We are using this to know when the notebook is ready
                # and display the stop button on the UI.
                if self.jupyter_works[username].token:
                    jupyter_config["token"] = self.jupyter_works[username].token

                # Step 5: Stop the work if the user requested it.
                if jupyter_config['stop']:
                    self.jupyter_works[username].stop()
                    self.jupyter_config_requests.pop(idx)

        def configure_layout(self):
            return StreamlitFrontend(render_fn=render_fn)


The StreamLit UI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the UI below, we receive the **state** of the Jupyter Manager and it can be modified directly from the UI interaction.

.. code-block:: python

    def render_fn(state):
        import streamlit as st

        # Step 1: Enable users to select their notebooks and create them
        column_1, column_2, column_3 = st.columns(3)
        with column_1:
            create_jupyter = st.button("Create Jupyter Notebook")
        with column_2:
            username = st.text_input('Enter your username', "tchaton")
            assert username
        with column_3:
            use_gpu = st.checkbox('Use GPU')

        # Step 2: If a user clicked the button, add an element to the list of configs
        # Note: state.jupyter_config_requests = ... will sent the state update to the component.
        if create_jupyter:
            new_config = [{"use_gpu": use_gpu, "token": None, "username": username, "stop": False}]
            state.jupyter_config_requests = state.jupyter_config_requests + new_config

        # Step 3: List of running notebooks.
        for idx, config in enumerate(state.jupyter_config_requests):
            column_1, column_2, column_3 = st.columns(3)
            with column_1:
                if not idx:
                    st.write(f"Idx")
                st.write(f"{idx}")
            with column_2:
                if not idx:
                    st.write(f"Use GPU")
                st.write(config['use_gpu'])
            with column_3:
                if not idx:
                    st.write(f"Stop")
                if config["token"]:
                    should_stop = st.button("Stop this notebook")

                    # Step 4: Change stop if the user clicked the button
                    if should_stop:
                        config["stop"] = should_stop
                        state.jupyter_config_requests = state.jupyter_config_requests
