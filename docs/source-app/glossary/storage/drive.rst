#############
Drive Storage
#############

**Audience:** Users who want to put, list and get files from a shared disk space.


The Lightning Storage system makes it easy to share files between LightningWork so you can run your app both locally and in the cloud without changing the code.

----

*****************
What is a Drive ?
*****************

The Drive object provides a central place for your components to share data.

The drive acts as an isolate folder and any component can access it by knowing its name.

Your components can put, list, get, delete files from and to the Drive (except LightningFlow's).

----

****************************
Why should I use the Drive ?
****************************

Every instance of the Drive object acts as a Google Drive or Dropbox.

By sharing the drive between components through the flow,
several components can have a shared place to read and write files from.

----

*************************
How do I create a Drive ?
*************************

In order to create a Drive, you simply need to pass its name with the prefix ``lit://`` as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from lightning_app.storage import Drive

    # The identifier of this Drive is ``drive_1``
    # Note: You need to add Lightning protocol ``lit://`` as a prefix.

    drive_1 = Drive("lit://drive_1")

    # The identifier of this Drive is ``drive_2``
    drive_2 = Drive("lit://drive_2")

Any components can create a drive object.

.. code-block:: python

    from lightning_app import LightningFlow, LightningWork
    from lightning_app.storage import Drive

    class Flow(LightningFlow):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.drive_1 = Drive("lit://drive_1")

        def run(self):
            ...

    class Work(LightningWork):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.drive_1 = Drive("lit://drive_1")

        def run(self):
            ...

----

*************************************
What actions does the drive support ?
*************************************

A drive supports put, list, get, delete actions.

.. code-block:: python

    from lightning_app.storage import Drive

    drive = Drive("lit://drive")

    drive.list(".") # Returns [] as empty

    # Created file.
    with open("a.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("Hello World !")

    drive.put("a.txt")

    drive.list(".") # Returns ["a.txt"] as the file copied in the Drive during the put action.

    drive.get("a.txt") # Get the file into the current worker

    drive.delete("a.txt")

    drive.list(".") # Returns [] as empty

******************************************
How does component interacts with drives ?
******************************************

Here is an illustrated code example on how to create drives within works.

.. figure::  https://pl-flash-data.s3.amazonaws.com/assets_lightning/drive_2.png

.. code-block:: python

    from lightning_app import LightningFlow, LightningWork
    from lightning_app.core.app import LightningApp
    from lightning_app.storage.drive import Drive


    class Work_A(LightningWork):

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            # The identifier of the Drive is ``drive_1``
            # Note: You need to add Lightning protocol ``lit://`` as a prefix.
            self.drive_1 = Drive("lit://drive_1")

        def run(self):
            # 1. Create a file.
            with open("a.txt", "w") as f:
                f.write("Hello World !")

            # 2. Put the file into the drive.
            self.drive_1.put("a.txt")


    class Work_B(LightningWork):

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()

            # Note: Work B has access 2 drives.

            # The identifier of this Drive is ``drive_1``
            self.drive_1 = Drive("lit://drive_1")
            # The identifier of this Drive is ``drive_2``
            self.drive_2 = Drive("lit://drive_2")

        def run(self):
            # 1. Create a file.
            with open("b.txt", "w") as f:
                f.write("Hello World !")

            # 2. Put the file into both drives.
            self.drive_1.put("b.txt")
            self.drive_2.put("b.txt")

    class Work_C(LightningWork):

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.drive_2 = Drive("lit://drive_2")

        def run(self):
            # 1. Create a file.
            with open("c.txt", "w") as f:
                f.write("Hello World !")

            # 2. Put the file into the drive.
            self.drive_2.put("c.txt")

******************************************
How can I transfer files with the Drive  ?
******************************************

In the example below, the Drive is created by the flow and passed to its LightningWork's.

The ``Work_1`` put a file **a.txt** in the **Drive("lit://this_drive_id")** and the ``Work_2`` can list and get the **a.txt** file from it.
